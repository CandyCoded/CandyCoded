### CreateAssetBundles

To setup either a scene or prefab for export to an asset bundle, select the object and navigate to the bottom of the inspector where you will find a small section with a label **AssetBundle**. Give the object a name, right-click in the **Assets** panel and click **CandyCoded > Tools > Build Asset Bundles**. A new folder will be created in your **Assets** directory with the created asset bundles.
