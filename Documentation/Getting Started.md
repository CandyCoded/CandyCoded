## Getting Started

Once you have imported CandyCoded into your project you can start using it right away. Components like the Gizmo and Screenshake can be found via the Add Component button in the Inspector. Editor extensions like `DisplayInInspector` and `EnumMask` are automatically available to all scripts. Functionality like the Animate and Raycast methods are tucked away behind the CandyCoded namespace which can be used either by adding the namespace to a class header or calling the method directly.
